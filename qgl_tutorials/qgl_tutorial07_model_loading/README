This project uses CMake instead of qmake because the 
assimp library builds with qmake.  You must have CMake
installed <www.cmake.org>.  Run the cmake-gui and point
to the CMakeList.txt in this directory.  The assimp library
doesn't read from a Qt resource file so you will have to 
make sure that the .obj file (suzanne.obj) resides in the
same directory as the executable.
